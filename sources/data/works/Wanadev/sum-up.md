I am currently hired by __Wanadev__ I contribute to develop our solution of __house modeling app__ for casual users.

The project __Wanaplan__ is based use __WebGL__ to render the house. It works well on every regular computer.

As the project target a large panel of user, the UI is clear and simple. We use to take the game _The sim's_ as example to describe how the app feels.

My daily work is a mix of 3d geometry, WebGL and large architecture design.

 * I made the __furniture configurator__ which allows to edit a furniture by grabbing streching a side.

 * I improve the performance on picking, using a __octree__ structure to perfom spacial queries.

 * I re-work the __magnetism__ component to make it more stable and flexible. This componant is responsible of validating the object position when the user move them. 

 * And a lot more incoming !
