__js13kgames__ is a coding challenge. You got 13k to make an html5 game. The theme this year is the four elements earth, air, fire, water.

I decided to go with a __Tower Defence__. I set up a nice isometric 3D map, which is fully rotatable!

Then I run out of time because I got to do some important stuffs by the time. So the game is not quite finished, I rushed the developpement the last night to deliver something which work. Still, it's barely playable.
