The non-boring version of my CV. The one that __bursts__.

I made a animation where you can see my CV being burst out, following a cool __dubstep__ backed choreography.

You totatly should watch it!

It's based on top of __Threejs__ working with __cannonjs__ to simulate the physic.

I also did the nice intro.
