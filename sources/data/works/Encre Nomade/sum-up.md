In summer 2012, I work as trainee during 3 months in __Encre Nomade__ a small start-up which made an interactive book reader with enhanced animations.

We develop a **WYSIWYG** editor which allows to write the story and add animations, sounds ...

Both the reader and the editor app are built on top of **HTML5** technologhies.

I develop core feature of the editor, and produce contents for the stories, mostly mini-games.
