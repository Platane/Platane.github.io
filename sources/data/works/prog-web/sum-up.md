Another scholar project, the theme was setting up a web app where users can submit list of items and rate them.

The context was volontary large I guess.

II made a __J2EE__ backed website which was mandatory. For each list the items are given a __ELO__ score. Items are displayed by peers, users can vote for one or the other, which increase it's score.

A page display cool charts about items in the list. Featuring a __physic based graph__ where items are push or pull together depending on their relative score.


I can't run the glassFish server anymore, but I made a static version of the website which will stay longer for the posterity.

_( Yes, the design is little bit outdated )_
