Look! I made a __html5 game__!

It was under the frame of a scolar project, the goal was to create a soft with a vague link with the english langage or culture.

In this game, you play as space marine holding a hill surounded by an army of goblins. The purpose is of course to blast them.

Here are the __basis mecanics__ :

 * Each goblin comes with a sentence which contains an error
 * You have to rewrite the sentence without the error, typing the words on your keyboard
 * The faster you type, the more goblin you slay!

And there are bonuses !

 * reload your weapon when the screen pops on, press repeatitly `*` or `!`
 * enleash powerfull power with `1` or `2` buttons

Contains a cool intro too!
