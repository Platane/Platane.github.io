A research team at __inria__ offer me to develop an app to present theirs jobs.

The result is a sort of game about a __Turing engine__ which have two dimensions map instead of simple one dimension band. It allows to visualize in a better way the algorithm running.

The app comes with a set of fifteen exercice, in which the user have to solve a problem using an algorithm written into the two dimension band.

It's all in Js. notice the fully navigable map and the __cool effects__ when the engine is running.
