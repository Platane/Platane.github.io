I did the 20th __global game__ with some friends at the Nancy spot.

We made a game in __48h__, barely sleeping.

In this game, the goal is to guide a ray from a point to another using mirrors, prisms an filters.

Altougth the game is pretty hard to play, the gameplay offers a lot of combinaisons. 


We made it in __Java__ with __libGDX__ in order to have it working on smartphone.

I mostly made the ray casting engine, and the graphic assets.
