I wanted to work on a beautiful web design project.

With a friend of mine, we polish the design of a gastronomic portefolio where the acid filtered images are certainly not meant to be taken seriously.

Notice the cool __css effects__.

The contents are delivered from an __python app engine__ serveur. __Bootstrap__ is used to ensure the MV linkage.

_Thanks Lisa, always nice to work with you._
