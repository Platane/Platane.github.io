A software development agency, __prometheus computing__ proposes to us to develop an __UML diagram editor__ web app which can be efficient and customizable enougth to be integrated in their process and generate code from the diagram.

I work in a four member team with __Cedric Grard__ and two other guys which pissed me off. It was a 6 months academic project.

The whole app is powered by __Angular__. I myself work the interactive graph zone. 

* I write components on top of Angular with a custom event mecanism to update the render, for performance issues. 

* The rendering is a mix of the good parts of __html canvas__ and simple __dom elements__ to minimize the repaint time.

* I write an algorithm to easily draw links between classes. It is designed to __smartly__ propose a path which do not cross the others. And whereas let the user modify the path as he wish.

Our work is not publishable. I am afraid you will have to go with the poor animated gif I made.
