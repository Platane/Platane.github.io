Hi, I just finished to build my personal website. It's made of some cool stuffs. You might want to know what.

Jenkins inspired solution
================


I don't like __CMS__, as I don't like most frameworks. I often find myself regreting the use of one when I lose time finding how to do things which are not in the common usage examples. So heavy CMS are definitively out of discussing for my website.

In other hand, I want to have a clean separation between __contents__ and __presentation__. I want to be able to deeply alter the layout of the site without having to touch the posts I wrote. I also want to easily add contents.

I am not a huge fan of __php__ , I prefer avoid using it. As most of the cheap hosting solutions mostly offer only php as server-side langage, I wish to write less server code as possible.





 
    var code = {e:2};
    while( true ){
        code.e ++
    }



Isn't that great?
